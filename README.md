# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo contains the script created for the Course 3: Getting and Cleaning Data project, as well as a Codebook.md. The objective of this project is to write a code that cleans and sumarizes the data from the provided UCI HAR Dataset.

## File Descriptions

- run_analysis.R: This file contains the script that performs the data cleaning and summarizes the UCI HAR Dataset.
- CodeBook.md: This file contains the documentation of the dataset, variables, and transformations performed.

## How to use scripts

1. As described in the run_analysis.R, it is crucial to set your working directory to the location of the UCI HAR Dataset folder inside your computer.
2. Ensure 'dplyr' is installed on your version of R.
3. Run 'run_analysis.R' to perform the analysis and generate the tidy dataset.
